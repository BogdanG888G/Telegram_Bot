# Telegram_Bot
WARNING!

Because of separate sections of the code, some may get angry at me and accuse me of "shit code". This is the very first time I've done something like this myself and up to this time I've written a maximum of ~40 lines of code. I was guided by various articles on Habré, Stack Overflow, etc., I watched various YouTube videos related to the topic of my project, and still there are serious errors in the code at the moment, so I don’t beat myself in the chest and don’t say, that I am a professional and a great coder. I just want to go further in this area and do something cool and useful :)

Just my little project (PET)

In general, the idea is to have a bot next to a person on a long journey on a train, which would make a pleasant company for the user so that he does not get bored on the road.

As far as I see it this way: from the very beginning of use, the bot will ask the user's route (start and end points, for example, Kislovodsk - Moscow). Based on this route, the bot will automatically suggest a list of stations where the train will stop. The user will select the station he is interested in from the list, and the bot will tell a little about the station itself (interesting facts related to it (if any, of course)) and about the city in which the station is located. In addition, there will be pictures of the station and a few pictures of the city.

I built several commands into the telegram bot itself (route names ~ 20). I took the Kislovodsk-Moscow route (on which I personally will go to the university) and just took the Kislovodsk station, found some information about it, then inserted interesting facts about the city into the code, and added a few pictures to make it more interesting.
